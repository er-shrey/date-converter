Why:
Sometimes in the real world dynamic web apps, we work on data, which is mostly time related data.
So for converting data with respect to any timezone level, we can use this AngularJS service.

Parameter: Timestamp epoch.

Methods:
dateTimePart : It will return Date as well as time after conversion of the timestamp epoch.

datePart : It will return Date part only after conversion of the timestamp epoch.

timePart : It will return Time part only after conversion of the timestamp epoch.

timeZoneName: It will return the timeZone name.

timefromGMT : It returns the localTimeZone hours with respect to GMT.

preferedDate : It returns the epoch only after converting it to the needed timezone epoch.
